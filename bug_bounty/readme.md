# About this repository
This repository contains critical, high, medium, and low-severity bugs that I discovered while participating in bug bounty programs on Immunefi. I have obtained permission to disclose all the bugs, reports, and names mentioned here. Otherwise, I do not share any write-ups until I receive the necessary permissions from the respective bug bounty teams or the Immunefi team.


## NOTE
Currently, there are no bug bounty write-ups included in this repository. This is because most of the bug bounty programs Iâ€™ve worked on require explicit permission before sharing any details about the vulnerabilities. Stay tuned for updates as I receive approvals to share more!
