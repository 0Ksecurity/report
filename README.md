# about this repository
This repository contains all the bugs Iâ€™ve discovered during my journey as a bug hunter. Many more bugs will be added to this repository over time. Please note that some bugs may not be documented in detail, as this often happens with BBPs (Bug Bounty Programs) since most of them require explicit permission to share information about the vulnerabilities.

Enjoy exploring
